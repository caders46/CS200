In order for the Chocoholics Anonymous system to operate effectively there needs to be 
requirements met. The system will primarily be computerized with the data storage, interface, 
and reporting all being digital. The data will be stored at the Chocoholics Anonymous Data 
Center and interacted with via the software on both Provider and Manager terminals. In regards 
to hardware, computer terminals are required to run and interact with the software. Data storage 
servers will also be required at the Chocoholics Anonymous Data Center. The system will 
interact with the external systems of ACME Accounting Services and the communications 
system (i.e. email, etc.). Continuous analysis may be needed throughout development.
